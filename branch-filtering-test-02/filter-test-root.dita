    <title>Branch Filtering Test</title>
    <body>
        <p>This is a test of using DITA filtering for different types of logical combinations.</p>
    <p>It consists of 4 branches, each of which includes the same topic to be filtered 4 different
      ways.</p>
    <p>The topic reflects four different condition attributes: <xmlatt>state</xmlatt>,
        <xmlatt>OFFICE_VISIT_COPAY</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>OFFICE_XRAY_SERVICES</xmlatt>,
        <xmlatt>is_true</xmlatt>, all specified in <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> using the generalization
      syntax:<codeblock>&lt;p props="state(TX FL) 
         OFFICE_VISIT_COPAY(ACTIVE)         
         OFFICE_XRAY_SERVICES(INCLUDED)">
&lt;p props="state(TX FL) 
        is_true(OFFICE_VISIT_COPAY_ACTIVE 
                PREVENTATIVE_CARE_OON_ACTIVE)"></codeblock></p>
    <p>The branches are filtered as follows:<ul id="ul_hqs_cqn_ldb">
        <li>All conditions true (set to "include")</li>
        <li>No conditions true (all set to "exclude")</li>
        <li>Office visit copay conditions true, preventative care conditions false</li>
        <li>Office visit copay conditions false, preventative care conditions true</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The conditions themselves reflect the need to express non-trivial boolean combinations of AND
      and OR relations between the different conditions and condition values.</p>
    <p>Each branch includes a unique topic that reflects the DITAVAL file used in that branch.</p>
