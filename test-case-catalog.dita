  <title>Test Case Catalog</title>
  <body>
    <p>This document includes the test case description topics from the various test cases. It
      serves as a catalog of test cases.</p>
    <p>If you create a new test case please add a reference to the test case description topic
      here.</p>
    <p>The source for these test cases is available on GitHub as <xref
        keyref="github-project-dita-test-cases"/>. </p>
    <note>This map also serves as a test of DITA 1.3 cross-deliverable links as it has
      cross-deliverable links to topics in the context of other root maps, either simply to relate
      the various test cases together or as a side effect of including test case description
      documents that themselves contain cross-deliverable links.</note>
