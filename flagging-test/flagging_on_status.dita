  <title>Flagging On Status</title>
  <body>
    <p>While the base OT does not implement flagging on the @status attribute there's no reason you
      can't (that is, the DITA spec does not explicitly disallow it, and even if it did, so what?
      Flagging is purely a presentation concern so the DITA standard cannot impose constraints
      there, either as a matter of policy or as a matter of practicality).</p>
