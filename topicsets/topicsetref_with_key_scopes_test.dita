  <title>Topicsetref With Key Scopes Test</title>
  <shortdesc>Uses key scopes with topicsetref.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <section spectitle="Overview">
      <p>There are three possible conditions involving key scopes and
          <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement>:<ol id="ol_bdn_4zg_qv">
          <li>The <xmlelement>topicset</xmlelement> specifies a key scope and the
              <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement> does not.</li>
          <li>The <xmlelement>topicset</xmlelement> does not specify a key scope and the
              <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement> does.</li>
          <li>Both <xmlelement>topicset</xmlelement> and <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement>
            specify a key scope.</li>
        </ol></p>
      <p>In all cases the key scopes should be preserved. The implication of the
          <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement> specification is that references to topic sets should
        be treated like other map-to-map references, which implies that the same semantics as for
        references to maps should apply, namely that any scope names defined on the referencing
        element are combined with scope names on the referenced element to create a single key scope
        with multiple names.</p>
      <p>If a processor treats a <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement> as a literal use-by-reference
        such that the reference is completely replaced by the referenced
          <xmlelement>topicset</xmlelement> element then it is likely to not preserve the scope
        names from the <xmlelement>topicsetref</xmlelement>.</p>
      <p>This test consists of two maps: Map A and Map B. </p>
      <p>Map B defines two topic sets, one with a key scope and one without.</p>
      <p>Map A has three topicset references: one with no scope that references the no-scope
        topicset, one with no scope that references the topic set with a scope, and one with a scope
        that references the topic set with a scope.</p>
      <p>Within the topic sets are topics that include key references to the unqualified keys
        defined within the topic set.</p>
      <p>Within Map A are references to topics that have scope-qualified key references to the keys
        defined within the topic set, using both the scope names from the topicset reference and
        from the topic set. All the links should resolve.</p>
    </section>
    <section spectitle="Expected Results">
      <p>The DITA 1.3 specification is silent on the explicit implications for key scopes on topic
        set references. However, treating them like other map references seems like the most
        reasonable (and most useful) interpretation.</p>
      <p>If this interpretation is used, then all the key references in all the topics should
        resolve.</p>
