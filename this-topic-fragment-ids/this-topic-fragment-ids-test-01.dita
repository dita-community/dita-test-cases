  <title>This-Topic Fragment ID Test 01</title>
  <shortdesc>Tests the resolution of this-topic fragment IDs within elements used by content
    reference.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <section spectitle="Overview">
      <p>The DITA 1.3 specification requires that these references be resolved in the context of the
        referencing topic, not the topic that contains the re-used elements. This means that these
        references must be resolved after content reference resolution has been performed.</p>
    </section>
    <section spectitle="Expected Results">
      <p>For task test-case-01, which uses the steps by conref, the reference from step 3 to step 1
        should be resolved in the context of the test-case-01 topic.</p>
      <p>For task warehouse-task-01 when used directly from the map, the reference from step 3 to
        step 1 should be resolved in the context of the warehouse topic as rendered for that
        normal-role use.</p>
