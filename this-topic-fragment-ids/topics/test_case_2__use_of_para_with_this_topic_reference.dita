  <title>Test Case 2: Use of Para With This-Topic Reference</title>
  <body>
    <p>This topic contains a conref to a paragraph that contains a this-topic fragment ID reference
      to the ID "target-section". The expectation is that the reference will be resolved to the
      section with that ID in this topic, not in the topic that contains the paragraph as authored
      (the warehouse topic).</p>

    <section id="target-section">
      <title>Target Section in Using Topic</title>
      <p>This section is in the topic that uses the paragraph with the this-topic fragment ID by
        conref.</p>
