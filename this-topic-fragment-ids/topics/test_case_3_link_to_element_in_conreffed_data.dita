      <p>This is a link to step 2 using "#test_case_3_link_to_conreffed_step/step-02", which may or may not be rendered as a link to the
        reused step 2: <xref href="#test_case_3_link_to_conreffed_step/step-02"/>.
        This link as authored is incorrect because there is no element with the ID "step-02" in topic "test_case_3_link_to_conreffed_step" as authored, only 
        after conref resolution (and assuming that conref resolution produces a literal XML result).
