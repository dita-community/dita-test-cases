  <title>Tests for &quot;This Topic&quot; Fragment Identifiers</title>
  <body>
    <p>This publication tests handling of "this topic" fragment identifiers.</p>
    <p>"This topic" fragment identifiers are new for DITA 1.3. They use a "." (period) in place of
      the topic ID part of a fragment identifier (the part after the "#"). This feature allows for
      both convenient references to elements within the same topic and handles the case of re-using
      elements via conref where the elements contain references to other elements, either in the
      same set of re-used elements or to a target expected to be within the topic that uses the
      referencing element by conref.</p>
    <section>
      <title>Test Case 1: Re-used steps with links among the steps</title>
      <p>In this case, a set of steps is used by reference. The steps have links to other steps
        within the same task,
        e.g.:<codeblock>&lt;stepresult>
  &lt;p>See &lt;xref href="<b>#./ssms-launch-step</b>"/> and  
  &lt;xref href="<b>#./expand-db-step</b>"/>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/stepresult></codeblock></p>
      <p>The expected result is that the references are resolved in the context of referencing
        topic, not in the context of the topic can contains the referenced steps as authored (e.g.,
        the "warehouse" topic with the steps).</p>
      <p>The task that uses the steps by reference: <xref keyref="test-case-01"/></p>
      <p>The warehouse task, used directly: <xref keyref="task-direct-use"/>

      <title>Test Case 2: Link from within re-used content to element outside re-used
        content</title>
      <p>In this case, the re-used content contains a this-topic reference to an element that is
        expected to exist within the referencing topic. The this-topic reference should be resolved
        after content reference resolution so that the link is to the element within the referencing
        topic, not the element within the topic containing the re-used element as authored.</p>
      <p>Topic that uses the paragraph with the this-topic crossref: <xref keyref="test-case-02"
        /></p>
      <p>Warehouse topic used directly: <xref keyref="warehouse-topic-direct-use"/></p>
