Informal repository for DITA test case documents
================================================

This repository is a place to capture DITA test case documents
for whatever aspect of DITA you want to test.

This is NOT any sort of official set of test cases. It has
absolutely no affiliation with the OASIS Open DITA Technical Committee.
It's just a convenient place to capture tests that will be of 
general interest.

Please feel free to contribute additional test cases via pull
request.

Test cases should be as small as possible and self-describing so
it's clear from the files what is being tested and what the
expected result is. The test case should refer to the parts
of the DITA specification it is testing. 

The DITA specification is hosted here:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/

For references to the Architecture Specification, use the
base edition:
