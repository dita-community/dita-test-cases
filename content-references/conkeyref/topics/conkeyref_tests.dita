  <title>Content Key Reference Tests</title>
  <shortdesc>Tests various configurations of referencing and referenced elements for content key
    reference.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <section spectitle="Overview">
      <p>There are several cases for content reference reflecting different levels of specialization
        for the referencing or referenced element:<ol id="ul_t5c_xg2_pv">
          <li>Reference from a generic topic to elements in generic topics (same topic types)</li>
          <li>Reference from a more-specialized topic to elements in a generic (less specialized)
            topic</li>
          <li>Reference from a less-specialized topic to a more-specialized topic</li>
        </ol></p>
      <p>Case (2) is not allowed when strong content reference constraints are enforced. However, by
        default weak constraints, not strong constraints, are in effect. Processors may provide the
        option of making all constraints strong. </p>
      <p>These combinations of specialization are not specific to content key referencesâ€”the rules
        are the same whether you use <xmlatt>conkeyref</xmlatt>
        <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt>. However, since you should never <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> these tests
        are constructed using key references.</p>
    </section>
    <section spectitle="Expected Results">
      <p>Cases (1) and (3) should always work. Case (2) should fail, or at least generate a warning,
        when strong content reference constraints are in effect (but remember that weak constraints
        is the default). When weak content reference constraints are in effect then case (2) should
        succeed.</p>
